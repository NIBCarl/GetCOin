GEN Coin White Paper

Introduction

GEN Coin is a Solana-based meme coin with a purpose: to fund community projects that empowers the community. By combining the virality of meme coins with the impact of non-profit organizations, GEN Coin offers a unique opportunity for investors to participate in a movement that builds community value. 

Problem Statement
The cryptocurrency market is filled with speculative assets that offer no real utility or social good. Meme coins, in particular, are often seen as pure speculation without any underlying value.

GEN Coin aims to change this narrative by creating a meme coin that not only offers potential financial returns but also drives real-world impact through its non-profit model.  Traditional methods of philanthropy are often inefficient and lack transparency, making it hard to ensure that funds reach those who need them most.

Solution

GEN Coin is built on the Solana blockchain, known for its speed and low transaction costs, making it ideal for efficient and scalable operations.

•	Token Distribution:
o	Public Sale (40%): To raise funds and engage early supporters.
o	GEN Council Budget (15%): To fund operations and strategic initiatives.
o	Launch (5%): For initial activities and community engagement.
o	Liquidity (20%): To ensure a stable trading environment.
o	Community Fund (20%): To fund community projects directly.

•	Locking Strategy: To ensure price stability and long-term growth, a significant portion of tokens are locked for a period, creating scarcity and driving value:
o	Public Sale:
	Pre-Development (8%, 80M): 100% locked for 12 months.
	Presale (32%, 320M): 60% locked for 12 months, 40% unlocked.
o	Launch (5%, 50M): 100% unlocked at launch.
o	Liquidity (20%, 200M): 100% locked indefinitely.
o	Community Fund (20%, 200M): 100% locked for 12 months; unlocked as needed to fund community projects.
•	Community Governance: The GEN Council, composed of 8 to 10 community, business, and banking leaders, will guide the project and make decisions on fund allocations.

By combining the fun and virality of meme coins with the purpose of a non-profit, GEN Coin offers a unique value proposition: financial returns coupled with social impact.

Tokenomics

•	Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 GEN tokens

•	Distribution:
o	Public Sale (40%, 400,000,000 tokens):
	Pre-Development (8%, 80,000,000 tokens): 100% locked for 12 months
	Presale (32%, 320,000,000 tokens): 60% locked for 12 months, 40% unlocked
o	GEN Council Operating Budget (15%, 150,000,000 tokens): Locked for 12 months
o	Launch (5%, 50,000,000 tokens): 100% unlocked at launch
o	Liquidity (20%, 200,000,000 tokens)): Locked indefinitely
o	Community Fund (20%, 200,000,000 tokens): Locked for 12 months; unlocked to fund community projects as determined by the GEN Council.

•	Potential Returns: If GEN Coin reaches a $50 million market cap, early investors stand to gain significant returns. For example, a $25,000 investment in the presale could be worth approximately $500,000 at $50 million cap (assuming certain conditions). Our goal is to reach at least $20 million market cap in the first year, with plans to grow further in subsequent years through community-driven initiatives and strategic partnerships.

•	Transaction Mechanism: We are exploring ways to stabilize the token and fund operations, potentially through a transaction tax or other mechanisms, but currently focusing on locking strategies.

Community and Governance

The GEN Council will be the steering committee, ensuring that the project stays true to its mission. Comprising leaders from various sectors, they will make decisions on how to allocate funds, engage with the community, and drive growth.

Community members are encouraged to participate in discussions, provide feedback, and contribute to the project's growth through various channels, including social media and dedicated platforms.
Together, we are committed to creating a lasting impact and building a strong, vibrant community dedicated to the success of GEN Coin.
